# HIV LTR Motif Analysis

### Results: 
* all_hits.tsv – Raw FIMO motif hits after light cleanup and overlap de-duplication (keeps higher-scoring hit per overlapping pair). Uses the non-redundant motif set: vierstra motif clustering.

* counts.tsv – Sequence × TF (family/label) count matrix derived from all_hits.tsv (columns with all-zero counts removed). This is the input for the heatmap.

* heatmap.png – PNG heatmap of counts.tsv (rows = sequences; columns = TF groups).

* heatmap.pdf – Vector (PDF) version of the same heatmap.
